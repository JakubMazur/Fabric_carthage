# WinguFabric

Since [official Fabric support site](https://fabric.io/kits/ios/crashlytics/install) does not provide [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) support. This is a simple framework only for embedded Fabric & Crashlytics.

Version of **WinguFabric** will be always the same as Crashlytics embedded. 

Current version is: **3.8.4**. 

To install it with Carthage

```github "JakubMazur/WinguFabric"```
